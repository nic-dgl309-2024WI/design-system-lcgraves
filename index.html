    <p>
      I'm originally from the Toronto area and have moved around quite a bit around Canada and the United States. My family and I moved back to Vancouver Island in 2021 and have been loving the easy access to nature and the ocean. I have a background in philosophy and social work but have recently gone back to school for digital web design and development and am currently in the DIGITAL Design + Development Post Graduate program at North Island College. Fun facts: I love trail running, wine and knitting. Or at least I used to, before kids!
