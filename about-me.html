    <p>
      I'm originally from the Toronto area and have been lucky enough to call many places across Canada and the U.S. my home. In 2021, My family and I set down roots in Courtenay on Vancouver Island where we've been loving the proximity to nature and the ocean. My professional path has been equally dynamic. With an academic foundation in philsophy and work experience in the field of social work, I've always been driven by a passion for understanding and improving the human experience. This passion recently steered me towards the digital creativity and technology sphere. I'm currently in the DIGITAL Design + Development Post Graduate program at North Island College, where I'm learning the fundamentals of digital development.

      Outside the digital sphere, you can find me out on the trails running with my dog Summer, drinking red wine, or reading novels that delve deeply into the complexity of the human condition. My journey from philosophy to front-end development reflects my belief in continuous learning and adapting, qualities I bring to every project. I look forward to bringing this blend of diverse life experiences and technical skills to create engaging, user-friendly digital experiences.
